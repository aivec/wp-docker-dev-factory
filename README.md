# Local WordPress with Docker (an interactive CLI)
Create local WordPress sites with Docker, **the easy way**.

## Why?
The purpose of this library is for easy creation *and management* of local WordPress development environments with Docker. Under the hood, this library uses `visiblevc`'s excellent [Docker images](https://github.com/visiblevc/wordpress-starter) as the base and adds CLI options via a `nodejs` script to make environment management even easier.

With most other tools, the user must manually create and manage `docker-compose.yml` files. This method has several drawbacks though. `docker-compose` files are not tailored to WordPress specifically and require at least basic knowledge of Docker. Docker is a fantastic tool but can eat up a lot of development time. Another big problem for development, in particular, is that `docker-compose` files are intended to be mostly unchanged. Their rigidity is not well suited for development environments. In terms of WordPress, this could be mounting/unmounting plugin/theme folders, changing the PHP version, importing SQL dump files, pulling third-party non-free plugins/themes from an SSH server, etc. 

Instead, this tool uses `JSON` files structured specifically for managing WordPress environments. With this approach, you can easily manage environments without any prior knowledge of Docker.

This library is **only for managing development environments** and is not intended for creating production ready containers.

## Main features:
- Mount local plugin/theme folders **from anywhere on your system**
- Download and install plugins/themes **automatically** on start-up
- Download and install private plugins/themes via SSH/FTP **automatically** on start-up
- XDebug built-in for easy debugging
- Local SMTP mail server with [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog)
- `ngrok` support for easy SSL testing on localhost
- Take a snapshot of your environment and re-use for significantly reduced start-up time
- Configurable WordPress version
- Configurable PHP version (`7.2`, `7.3`, `7.4`, or `8.0`)
- Configurable PHP environment variables
- Import a database on environment start-up (with URL replacement)
- Import and replace the database of a **running** environment (with URL replacement)
- Export an environments database
- A single `phpMyAdmin` container for all of your environments
- Use proxy URL for media files
- Mount local `uploads` folder

## Requirements
- nodeãƒ»npm
- docker

## Installation
Install globally with `npm`.
```sh
$ npm -g install @aivec/wp-docker-dev-factory
```

## Quickstart Guide
To spin-up a minimal environment, create a file named `wp-instances.json` with the following contents:
```json
{
  "instanceName": "my-local-wordpress",
  "containerPort": 8000,
  "locale": "en_US",
  "downloadPlugins": ["wordpress-plugin-1", "wordpress-plugin-2"],
  "downloadThemes": ["wordpress-theme-1", "wordpress-theme-2"],
  "localPlugins": [
    "/absolute/path/to/plugin/directory",
    "relative/path/to/plugin/directory",
    "../relative/path/to/plugin/directory"
  ],
  "localThemes": [
    "/absolute/path/to/theme/directory",
    "relative/path/to/theme/directory",
    "../relative/path/to/theme/directory"
  ]
}
```
Where:
- [`instanceName`](#---instancename) is the environment name and title of your website.
- [`containerPort`](#---containerPort) is the port number the environment will expose. In this case the final URL will be `localhost:8000`.
- [`locale`](#---locale) is the language you want for the WordPress install.
- [`downloadPlugins`](#---downloadplugins) is a list of any number of publicly available WordPress plugins to be downloaded.
- [`downloadThemes`](#---downloadthemes) is a list of any number of publicly available WordPress themes to be downloaded.
- [`localPlugins`](#---localplugins) is a list of absolute or relative paths to any number of local plugin folders.
- [`localThemes`](#---localthemes) is a list of absolute or relative paths to any number of local theme folders.

After setting up your config file, invoke the CLI tool from within the folder where your `wp-instances.json` file is saved:
```sh
$ aivec-wpdocker
```

A select prompt will appear:

<img src="media/action-select.png" alt="example action-select" />

Press the enter key on `Start WordPress` and wait for the environment to be created (if this is your first time it might take a while). After the environment is created, open your browser and navigate to [localhost:8000/wp-admin](localhost:8000/wp-admin).

You should see the WordPress login screen. Login with the default username and password `root`.
That's it!

A full example config can be found [here](examples/wp-instances.json). For a detailed description of every setting, refer to the [JSON Structure section](#json-structure).

## CLI Usage
The CLI is completely interactive. There are two ways to use it:
1. With no arguments
2. With a relative/absolute path

If you invoke `aivec-wpdocker` with no arguments, it will look for a `wp-instances.json` file in the current directory.

Alternatively, you can pass a relative or absolute path as an argument to tell the CLI where it should look for a `wp-instances.json` file. For example, assuming you have a `wp-instances.json` file in a folder called `configs` relative to the current directory, you would invoke the CLI like so:
```sh
$ aivec-wpdocker configs
```
The CLI has seven different operations:
| Operation | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `Start WordPress` | This will start the `WordPress` container, as well as create and run the `MySQL` and `phpMyAdmin` containers if they are not already created and running. If the environment's `WordPress` container is already running the CLI will abort with an error. Note that exiting with Ctrl+c will only stop the log stream, not the containers |
| `Stop WordPress` | This will stop the `WordPress` container for the selected environment. It **will not** stop the `MySQL` and `phpMyAdmin` containers. |
| `Save snapshot` | This will take a snapshot of the `WordPress` container's **filesystem** and save it as a `.tar` file. You can reference snapshot files with the [image](#---image) key in `wp-instances.json` to significantly reduce start-up time. |
| `Show server logs` | By default, when you start a `WordPress` container with `Start WordPress`, it will stream the `Apache` logs to standard output. You can use this command to pipe the log stream to your console again if you have exited the stream. |
| `Launch NGROK (local SSL)` | This will start the `ngrok` client for local SSL. Ctrl+c to stop the client. If you use `ngrok`, we **highly recommend** creating a free account on [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) so that you get more connections per minute. |
| `Update dumpfile` | This will only work if you specified [mysqlDumpfile](#---databasemysqldumpfile) in your config. By invoking this command, the dumpfile, which is mounted as a volume in the container, will be overwritten with a dump of the database of the selected environment |
| `Create new dumpfile` | This will create a dumpfile from the database of the selected environment and prompt the user to name the dumpfile. The dumpfile will be placed in a folder called `dumpfiles` in the same folder as `wp-instances.json`. If a `dumpfiles` folder does not already exist, it will be created. |
| `Import database` | This will prompt you to choose from a list of dump files in the `dumpfiles` directory adjacent to `wp-instances.json`. The selected dump file will then be used to **replace** the current database of the selected environment |

## Environments
Config files can contain any number of environments. To do so, wrap your config objects in an array:
```json
[
    {
        "instanceName": "my-local-wordpress-1",
        "containerPort": 8000,
        "locale": "en_US",
    },
    {
        "instanceName": "my-local-wordpress-2",
        "containerPort": 8010,
        "locale": "en_US",
    },
]
```
The CLI will then prompt you to choose which environment to use:

<img src="media/instance-select.png" alt="example instance-select" />

Every environment has exactly one `WordPress` container associated with it. Conversely, there is only one `MySQL` and `phpMyAdmin` container used for the databases of *all* `WordPress` environments. The naming pattern for containers is as follows:
| Container | Name | Example |
| ----- | ---- | ------ |
| `MySQL` | aivec_wp_mysql | |
| `phpMyAdmin` | aivec_wp_pma | |
| `WordPress` | [instanceName](#---instancename) | test-wordpress |
### Logging in
You can access `phpMyAdmin` at [localhost:22222](localhost:22222) with the following login information:
- Username: `root`
- Password: `root`

For `WordPress` environments that **do not** specify a [mysqlDumpfile](#---databasemysqldumpfile), the login information is the same:
- Username: `root`
- Password: `root`
### Lifecycle details
The database for each WordPress environment will only be created **the first time that environment is started**, regardless of whether you set a [mysqlDumpfile](#---databasemysqldumpfile) or not. If you want the database to be re-created every time you [start WordPress](#cli-usage), set [flushOnRestart](#---databaseflushonrestart) to `true`.

## MailHog
Emails sent via WordPress' built-in `wp_mail` function are caught by [MailHog](#mailhog). All outgoing email can be viewed in a web UI at [localhost:8025](localhost:8025)

## PHP Debugging
Any environment you create will have `XDebug` installed and configured by default listening on port `9900`. Visual Studio Code users can debug with the [PHP Debug extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-debug). Create a `launch.json` file and place it either in the `.vscode` directory of a workspace folder for a plugin/theme, or the `.vscode` directory of a workspace folder specifically for managing PHP debugging.

For users who have many plugins and themes scattered across their filesystem, we recommend creating a workspace folder for managing path mappings of all of those environments with a `launch.json` file like the following:
```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Listen for XDebug",
      "type": "php",
      "request": "launch",
      "port": 9900,
      "pathMappings": {
        "/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/my-plugin": "/home/user/path/to/my-plugin",
        "/var/www/html/wp-content/themes/my-theme": "/home/user/path/to/my-theme"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```
For users who would rather have a separate `launch.json` file for each of their plugin/theme workspaces, the file would look something like this:
```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Listen for XDebug",
      "type": "php",
      "request": "launch",
      "port": 9900,
      "pathMappings": {
        "/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/my-plugin": "{workspaceRoot}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
Some users prefer to keep all of their plugins and themes in a local WordPress installation folder. For those users, only one `launch.json` file is required:
```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Listen for XDebug",
      "type": "php",
      "request": "launch",
      "port": 9900,
      "pathMappings": {
        "/var/www/html/wp-content": "/absolute/path/to/my/local/wordpress/wp-content"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## JSON Structure
Reference for the `wp-instances.json` config file.
### -- instanceName
- *Required*
- *Type: `String`*
- Description: The `instanceName` becomes the title of your website. Note that even if you import a database with an SQL dumpfile that contains a WordPress install with a different title, `instanceName` will override it.
<hr>

### -- containerPort
- *Required*
- *Type: `Number`*
- Description: This is the port number for the WordPress installation. The final URL is `localhost` with this port number appended. A `containerPort` of 8000 would result in `localhost:8000`.
<hr>

### -- phpVersion
- *Optional*
- *Type: `String`*
- *Default: `7.3`*

- Description: Specify the WordPress version to install. Accepts any valid semver number, `latest`, or `nightly` for beta builds. Note that `nightly` builds only support the `en_US` [locale](#---locale). If you set this to `nightly` and the [locale](#---locale) is not `en_US`, `en_US` will be used anyways.
<hr>

### -- locale
- *Optional*
- *Type: `String`*
- *Default: `en_US`*
- Description: This is the locale used by WordPress to determine which language to use.
<hr>

### -- customInitScripts

- *Type: `String[]`*
- Description: May be any number of absolute or relative paths to `sh` or `bash` scripts to be executed at the end of environment creation. Note that absolute paths are resolved **starting from your home directory** and relative paths are resolved **starting from the folder of the `wp-instances.json` config file**
<hr>

### -- image
- *Optional*

<hr>

### -- uploadsUrl
- *Optional*
- *Type: `String`*
- Description: Specify a base URL for the `uploads` folder. If specified, any time a WordPress core function such as `wp_get_attachment_url` is called and the file doesn't exist locally, it will be fetched from the URL. Note that the URL should point to the `ABSPATH` of the WordPress install (eg: `https://www.my-site.com/cms` for a site where `uploads` exists at `cms/wp-content/uploads`).
<hr>

### -- database
- *Optional*
- *Type: `Object`*

    }
}
```
<hr>

### -- env

## FTP/SSH Config Files
For security reasons, FTP and SSH login information is not part of the `wp-instances.json` schema. Instead, the SSH and FTP properties in `wp-instances.json` contain a reference to their respective config files that exist elsewhere. This makes it easier and safer to share `wp-instances.json` config files between colleagues and teammates.

### <a name="ftp-config-files"></a>FTP
If [`confname`](#---ftpconfname) is used for your FTP config and a file named `<confname>.json` exists in the `aivec-devenv-configs` folder in your home directory, the file must have the following `JSON` structure:
```json
{
  "host": "some-host.com",
  "user": "ftpuser",
  "password": "somepassword"
}
```

If [`confpath`](#---ftpconfpath) is used for your FTP config then the `JSON` structure of the file must be the same as above.

Alternatively, if [`confname`](#---ftpconfname) is used for your FTP config and a file named `<confname>.json` *does not exist* in the `aivec-devenv-configs` folder in your home directory, the CLI will look for a key in `aivec-devenv-configs/ftp.json` with the same name as [`confname`](#---ftpconfname). For example, given that [`confname`](#---ftpconfname) is `my-ftp-conf`, the `ftp.json` would look like this:
```json
{
  "my-ftp-conf": {
    "host": "some-host.com",
    "user": "ftpuser",
    "password": "somepassword"
  }
}
```
This method allows you to have any number of unique configurations all in the same file.

### <a name="ssh-config-files"></a>SSH
The same rules used for FTP config resolution also apply to SSH configs. SSH configs must have the following `JSON` structure:
```json
{
  "host": "my-server.com",
  "user": "ssh-user",
  "privateKeyPath": "relativepath/sshkeys/my_key"
}
```
`privateKeyPath` can be either a relative or absolute path. Relative paths are resolved **starting from the same folder as the ssh config file**, while absolute paths are resolved **starting from the users home directory**.

Additionally, the private key **must not be password protected**. There are tools out there like `sshpass` for automating password input for password protected SSH keys, but in our experience this is not very reliable and not worth the effort. Our recommendation is to generate a passwordless SSH key pair where only non-interactive downloads are allowed.
